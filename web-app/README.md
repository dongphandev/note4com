This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Run locally
`npm start`

# Build sources for production deployment
`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
